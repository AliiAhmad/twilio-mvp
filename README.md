# Twilio MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

This project is a basic application demonstrating the use of Twilio for making and receiving calls. It serves as a starter kit for integrating Twilio into web applications.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) (for creating a secure tunnel to your localhost)

### Setup Twilio

1. **Create a Twilio Account**: 
   If you don't have one, sign up for a free Twilio account [here](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio).
   
2. **Get Twilio Credentials**:
   - Log in and navigate to the [Twilio Console Dashboard](https://www.twilio.com/console).
   - Note your `Account SID` and `Auth Token`.
   
3. **Obtain a Twilio Phone Number**:
   - In the `Phone Numbers` section, select or buy a Twilio phone number for making and receiving calls.

### Setup Ngrok

Ngrok allows you to expose your local development server to the internet.

1. **Install Ngrok**: 
   Download and install Ngrok from [here](https://ngrok.com/download).
   
2. **Run Ngrok**: 
   Set up a secure tunnel to your localhost following Ngrok's documentation.

### Run the Server

Navigate to your project directory and start the server:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
npm install
npm start
```
### Run Ngrok
```
ngrok http 3000
```
Replace 3000 with your server's port number.
### Dial Away!
With the server and Ngrok running, your application is now ready to make and receive calls using Twilio.
